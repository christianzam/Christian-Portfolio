          Let's grow your indoor plants indoors!!<br>
          Most of the time, indoor plants are already in containers, so no need to plant them.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>A good root system</strong> â€“ This is incredibly important when choosing a plant. Itâ€™s not practical to pull a plant out of its pot to check its roots but if it is a small plant, this can be done.
          Healthy roots are thick and light in color.
          <br>
          <strong>Foliage</strong> - Hereâ€™s a good rule of thumb when it comes to plantâ€™s foliage: if you canâ€™t see through it, the foliage is thick enough.
          <strong>Check for disease</strong> â€“ Some signs of a plant with pests or disease are: white dots, sticky residue on the leaves and a bad odor.
